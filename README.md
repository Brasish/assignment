# About this Assignment

This Website is an Assignment of Web Deployment and Publishing. It had its first part where we submitted our basic website. 
The 2nd part of the assignment was, Making it a responsive website. We had our task to make it optimised for the Mobile Device and HD TV use.
I started adding CSS style first then, For making it Responsive I added Codes like Viewport for making the site Responsive. Then, I tested in the mobile device. It was successful.
