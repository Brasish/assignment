The Responsive Website Assignment. 

This is a website about my Portfolio. I have added different styles. The First Version was about making a basic website. However, The second one is all about making it responsive. 

Firstly, I added Style.css file then, Started making adding codes like Viewport for making it responsive. I imported texts from  
https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto&display=swap. The Picture Brasish.jpg is my own photograph. The other icons used in the website i.e. Contact.png, home.png and work.png are sourced from https://www.pngix.com/. Hence, I don't own the Icon Pictures. 

The Embedded Youtube Videos:
All the videos embedded are my own works. It is uploaded in my own Youtube Channel.
